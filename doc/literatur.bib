abstract = "The asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP) is one of the most important combinatorial optimization problems. It allows us to solve, either directly or through a transformation, many real-world problems. We present in this paper a new competitive genetic algorithm to solve this problem. This algorithm has been checked on a set of 153 benchmark instances with known optimal solution and it outperforms the results obtained with previous \{ATSP\} heuristic methods. "
